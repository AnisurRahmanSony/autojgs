								<h2>Pet Owners</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p>Our pets are part of the family. We love them, and they give us their total and unconditional love in return. But sometimes they give us more than we bargained for, leaving you with a horrendous odor that is a real challenge to get rid of. From hairy seats and carpets, urine stains and odors when they get excited, big dogs that drool (St. Bernard’s), they get in the car wet with dirty muddy paws, to name a few, leaving your car smelling like a pet store, especially to non-family members.</p>
								<p>So, what can you do about those odors? You can take it to a company that details cars, or you can do it yourself. Most of the time the detailing company you hire uses ozone or some other foul-smelling odor bombs that don’t work and in some cases, make the problem worse. And if you try to rectify the problem you’ll probably buy the same stinky odor bombs.  That’s where the Just Gone odor elimination services come in. With the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System we can remove all odors in any type of vehicle – Autos, Vans, Buses, Trucks, SUV’s, Recreation Vehicles, all types of Watercraft, Semi-Cabs) 100% of the time – Guaranteed. Most vehicles can be deodorized in as little as 1 hour. (PLEASE NOTE: The source of the odor must be removed, vacuum the seats to remove excess pet hair and dander, wipe down all hard surfaces, remove any “gifts” left by your pets, have the seats and carpets professionally cleaned if heavily soiled.)</p>
								<p>The Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System sanitizes and deodorizes by first using an advanced “Dry Fog” system that gets everywhere to remove harmful germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and indoor contaminants without leaving any harmful residues. It doesn’t use harsh toxic chemicals, fragrances nor does it require time consuming manual wipe downs or rinsing. Even delicate surfaces and the heating and cooling systems can be sanitized against a multitude of germs, allergens, odors and indoor contaminates in a fraction of the time and with the highest degree of effectiveness. </p>
								<p>Second, utilizing our Patented Zoono Technology, our surface protector provides a defensive shield against mold, bacteria, and viruses. Zoono is antimicrobial nanotechnology that uses intelligent molecules to actively and consistently reduce pathogen loads on surfaces by using physics to kill germs instead of chemistry. What does that mean? It means that Zoono Technology is less toxic than Vitamin C, yet providing you with the Peace of Mind that your vehicle is odor free, and all odors and bacterial problems are effectively eliminated for up to 90 days. Nothing works as well as the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorizing System.</p>
								<h2 class="subhead">10 Tips on Elimination Pet Odors</h2>
								<p>#1. Best Tip of All – Give your pets regular baths using a shampoo that is recommended for your pet. Make sure that you use a shampoo formulated for your pet breed or type of pet. Use of human shampoos can cause problems because they use harsher chemicals and have a different pH that may do more damage than good for your pet.</p>
								<p>#2. Wash anything that is removal in your car using you washing machine and favorite laundry detergents. This includes your pet’s blankets, floor mats, and removable seat covers. Have your cars seats and carpets professionally cleaned on a regular basis</p>
								<p>#3. Vacuum Your Car on a Regular basis. This includes the seats, the carpets, floor mats, back window area on cars, the headliner and under the seats. Smells can come from pet hair and dander.</p>
								<p>#4. Removal of Pet Hair. Use a rubber bristle brush as it traps fur in its bristles with an electrostatic charge. Also, you can use a dryer sheet as it works on the same principle as the rubber bristle brush as it creates an electrostatic charge as it is rubbed across the seats, carpets, and headliner.</p>
								<p>#5 Scrub Down all surfaces on your Car. Wipe all surfaces down with a multi-purpose detergent on a regular basis.</p>
								<p>#6. Take Frequent Bathroom Breaks. Take them out before getting in the car and stop along the way as some pets become anxious or excited during their ride.</p>
								<p>#7 Put A Pet Mat on the Seat. This will help keep the hair off the seats and protect them in case your pet does have an accident.</p>
								<p>#8. Make Sure That They Are Clean Before They Get In. Remember, your pets don’t wipe their paws before they get in, so you have too. And dry them off the best you can because there is nothing like the smell of a wet doggie.</p>
								<p>#9. Use A Crate. Keeping your pet in a secured metal crate may be the best way to keep your car clean and you and your pet safe. It also keeps distractions to a minimum.</p>
								<p>#10. If All Else Fails. If you have done everything that you can to minimize the “Doggie Smell” there may be some underlying issues that may need to be addressed. If you have followed the above steps it may be time to visit the veterinarian for a check-up to ensure that your pet is in good health.</p>

											<h2>Zoono Hand sanitizer</h2>
											<p>Zoono Germfree 24 Hand Sanitizer is an FDA-compliant formulation of this technology. it is a revolutionary, long lasting, highly effective, water-based hand sanitizer that is nontoxic, kills 99.99% of germs on contact and keeps killing them for up to 24 hours.</p>
											<p>Zoono Germfree24 kills germs immediately like other hand sanitizers. But unlike traditional alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which only work while they are wet and quickly evaporate, as Zoono dries the intelligent Zoono molecules bond permanently to your skin, setting up a defensive barrier composed of billions of molecular “pins” that destroy germ cells for up to 24 hours. This means Zoono Germfree24 provides continuous antimicrobial protection all day with a single application. When you compare a product that works for a few minutes to one that lasts all day and factor in the convenience, continuity of protection and cost, there is no comparison.</p>
											<p>It is important to note that the 24-hour efficacy is driven by natural exfoliation of the skin, not product durability. Since the product bonds permanently to your skin, as the skin sloughs off, it takes the Zoono with it.</p>

								<h2>Buying a Used Car</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p>With the high price of new cars and how quickly they depreciate, you’re not alone when comes to looking for a used vehicle. Whether you are making that purchase from a dealership or a private party, finding the right car can be a real challenge. There are more that 250 million used cars on the road in the United States, and every year, close to 40 million used cars change hands every year.</p>
								<p>And while buying a used car may seem like a sensible option, when you make that purchase you need to be smart in your choices. Used cars that have problems or damage can become expensive complications for the unsuspecting buyer. Taking your chosen car to a mechanic can help find any mechanical issues, but what about the things you can’t see or feel. You don’t know who previously owned that car – were they heavy smokers, did they have pets, recent illnesses leaving behind germs, bacteria, and viruses? Has the interior of the car ever been flooded?</p>
								<p>The Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System sanitizes and deodorizes by first using an advanced “Dry Fog” system that gets everywhere to remove harmful germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and indoor contaminants without leaving any harmful residues. It doesn’t use harsh toxic chemicals, fragrances nor does it require time consuming manual wipe downs or rinsing. Even delicate surfaces and the heating and cooling systems can be sanitized against a multitude of germs, allergens, odors and indoor contaminates in a fraction of the time and with the highest degree of effectiveness.</p>
								<p>If you’re buying a vehicle from a dealership most likely that vehicle will be completely detailed. If you are buying it from a private party who knows what they will do. Most of the time if it needs to be deodorized the service providers utilize ozone or other foul-smelling odor bombs that don’t work and in some cases, make the problem even worse. That’s where the Just Gone odor elimination services come in. With the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System we can remove all odors in any type of vehicle – Autos, Vans, Buses, Trucks, SUV’s, Recreation Vehicles, all types of Watercraft, Semi-Cabs) 100% of the time – Guaranteed.

(PLEASE NOTE: The source of the odor must be removed once that has been determined, wipe down all hard surfaces, vacuum any debris from the seat, carpets, headliner, and under  the seats, and have the seats, and carpets professionally cleaned if they are heavily soled.)</p>

								<h2 class="subhead">10 Tips on Buying a Used Car</h2>
								<h2 class="question">Step 1: How Much Car Can You Afford?</h2>
								<p>A rule of thumb: If you're taking out a loan to pay for your car, your car payment shouldn't be more than 20 percent of your take-home pay. If you're sticking to a tight budget, you may want to spend even less. Used cars will need a little extra attention from time to time: new tires, maintenance and the like. And then there are the other ownership costs shoppers sometimes forget to account for, such as fuel and insurance.</p>
								<p>If the car you're planning to buy is out of warranty, it might be a good idea to set aside a "just-in-case" fund to cover any unexpected repairs.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 2: Build a Target List of Used Cars</h2>
								<p>It's no secret that the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry make for good used cars. But they might cost a few thousand more than a comparable Ford Fusion or Kia Optima, even though these are good cars, too. So if you're looking to save money, consider more than one brand. We suggest making a list of three cars that meet your needs and fall within your budget. <span>Edmunds reviews</span> have great information to guide your choices.</p>
								<p>If you're planning to buy a vehicle that is less than 5 years old, consider one that's <span>certified pre-owned</span> (CPO). CPO vehicles have long-term warranties that are backed by the carmakers, not just the dealership selling it to you. Franchised dealerships that sell that same brand new are the only ones who can sell a CPO car of the same brand. So if you wanted a CPO Chevy Cruze, for example, you'd need to buy it from a Chevy dealer.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 3: Check Prices</h2>
								<p>Prices are driven in part by where you're shopping. You'll find used cars in used-car sections of new-car dealerships, independent used-car lots, used-car retailers such as CarMax and websites where private-party sellers list their cars. Of the four, private-party cars will usually have the lowest selling price. CPO cars will usually cost the most, but for the reasons we've noted. To see what other people are paying for the models you've picked out, Edmunds offers a quick way to see the average price paid for the car in your area.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 4: Locate Used Cars for Sale in Your Area</h2>
								<p>One easy place to start building your target list is the Edmunds used-car inventory page. To find exactly the car you want, you can filter your search by many factors including the miles on the car's odometer, its price and features, and dealer's distance from you. Use the websites for other used-car marketplaces mentioned to save time.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 5: Check the Vehicle History Report</h2>
								<p>Unless you're buying the car from a close friend or family member who can vouch for its history, plan to get a vehicle history report. This is an essential early step. If the car you're looking at has a bad history report, the sooner you know the better.</p>
								<p>AutoCheck and Carfax are the two best-known sources for vehicle history reports, which can reveal vital information about the car, including whether the odometer has been rolled back or if it has a salvage title, which means it has been declared a total loss by the insurance company. You'll use the car's vehicle identification number (VIN) to get this information, and in some cases, all you need is the license plate number.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 6: Contact the Seller</h2>
								<p>Once you find a good prospective car, don't run out to see it. Call the seller first. This is a good way to establish a relationship with the seller and verify the information about the car. You can ask private-party sellers why they're parting with a car, or whether it has any mechanical problems. And if you're buying from a dealership, a phone call (or text) is the best way to ensure the car is still in stock.</p>
								<p>Sometimes the seller will mention something that wasn't in the ad that might change your decision to buy the car. If you want to go deeper, our used car questionnaire is a good reminder of what to ask. You will notice that the last question on our list is the asking price of the car. Although many people are tempted to negotiate even before they have laid eyes on the car, it's better to wait. Once you see the car, you can tie your offer to its condition.</p>
								<p>If things are going well, set up an appointment to test-drive the car. If possible, make it for daylight hours. That makes it easier to see the car's condition.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 7: Test-Drive the Car</h2>
								<p>Test-driving a used car is the best way to know if this is the right car make and model for you. It's also a good way to assess this particular car's condition. So tune out distractions and focus on the car. Here are some things to check:</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Is it easy to get in and out of the car without stooping or banging your head?</li>
										<li>Is there enough headroom, hip room and legroom? Remember to see how these feel in the backseat, too.</li>
										<li>Is the driving position comfortable? Do you sit too low, too high or just right in the car? Can you tilt or telescope the steering wheel for a better fit?</li>
										<li>Are the seats comfortable? Are they easily adjustable? Is there a lumbar support adjustment for the driver? How about the front-seat passenger?</li>
										<li>Do you see a lit "check engine" light? If so, get that problem checked out before buying.</li>
										<li>How is the visibility? Check the rearview mirror and the side mirrors. Look for potential blind spots.</li>
										<li>Use your nose. Do you smell gas, burning oil, or anything amiss?</li>
										<li>Check out the tires. How old are they? Is there enough tread left?</li>
										<li>How are the brakes? Are they doing the job of stopping the car? Do they squeak?</li>
										<li>Pop the hood. You don't have to know a lot about cars to see if something looks wrong. If something is leaking, steaming or covered in oil, it's time to ask questions.</li>
										<li>Does the air-conditioning blow cold? Do headlights, brake lights and turn indicators work? Test them to be sure.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>After the test drive, ask the owner or dealer if you can see the service records. These will show you if the car has had the scheduled maintenance performed on time.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 8: Have the Car Inspected</h2>
								<p>If you like the car, consider having it inspected by a mechanic before you buy it. If you don't have a mechanic, Google and Yelp are good places to read local shops' reviews. <span>A pre-purchase inspection</span> costs about $100 and can alert you to problems you may not find yourself. It's a smart investment.</p>
								<p>A private-party seller will probably allow you to do this without much resistance. Most dealerships will let you borrow a car to take to be inspected by an outside mechanic. You'll be paying the inspection, of course. If it is a CPO car, there's already been an inspection and a warranty is in place, so there is little reason to take it to a mechanic.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 9: Negotiate a Good Deal</h2>
								<p>Does the idea of "talking numbers" fill you with dread? It shouldn't. Negotiating doesn't have to be a drawn-out, traumatic experience. If you are reasonable and have a plan, chances are you can make a deal pretty quickly and easily:</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Decide ahead of time how much you're willing to spend to get the car. But don't start with this number in your discussion.</li>
										<li>Make an opening offer that is lower than your maximum price, but in the ballpark based on your average price paid research in Step</li>
										<li>3. Explain that you've done research on Edmunds or wherever else, so you have facts to support your offer.</li>
										<li>If you and the seller arrive at a price that sounds good to you and is near the average price paid, you're probably in good shape.</li>
										<li>And remember, the people on the other side probably hate negotiating too (even if it's their job).</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 10: Get the Paperwork Done</h2>
								<p>If you are at a dealership, you'll sign the contract in the finance and insurance office. There, you will likely be offered additional items, such as a warranty, anti-theft devices, prepaid service plans or fabric protection.</p>
								<p>Some people want the peace of mind that comes with extended warranties, so this is something you might want to consider (unless the car is still under the manufacturer's warranty or is a CPO vehicle). Review the dealership sales contract thoroughly. In most states, it lists the cost of the vehicle, a documentation fee, possibly a small charge for a smog certificate, sales tax and license fees.</p>
								<p>If you are buying a car from an individual owner, make sure the seller properly transfers the title and registration to you. It's important to <span>close the deal</span> correctly to avoid after-sale hassles. Before money changes hands, ask for the title (which is sometimes called the pink slip) and have the seller sign it over to you. Rules governing vehicle registration and licensing vary from state to state. If possible, check with your local department of motor vehicles to make sure there are no past-due registration fees you'd be responsible for should you buy the car. Whether you buy from a dealer or a private party, make sure you have insurance for the car before you drive it away.</p>
								<p>Once you've done the paperwork, it's time to celebrate your new purchase – maybe with a drive-through dinner. You deserve it!</p>

								<h2>How to Sell Your Car</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p>With the high price of new cars and how quickly they depreciate, that car that you babied for years by changing the oil every 3000 miles, kept it in the garage, rotated the tires regularly, had detailed frequently is now a hot commodity. But how do you let everybody know? How much is your car worth? Where do I list it? Those are just a few of the questions that you need to address.</p>
								<p>Sales of cars by private parties are on the rise. Trading your car in to the dealer may be a little simpler, but chances are good that you will not get as much for your car as you would if you sold it yourself. That is why many people choose to sell their cars themselves. More than 11 million cars are sold by private parties each year. And nearly 40 million used cars are sold each year, more than 3 times the number of new cars.</p>
								<p>To find out, we went to the EXPERTS to learn how to sell your car and get the most for your money – EDMUNDS – the experts in car evaluation and appraisals. Here is the information that they provided.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Steps to Selling Your Car</h2>

									<ol class="list-item">

									</ol>
								</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 1: Know the Market</h2>
								<p>Is your car going to be easy to sell? Is it a hot commodity? Or will you have to drop your price and search out additional avenues to sell it?</p>
								<p>Here are a few general rules to answer these questions:</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Family sedans, while unexciting to many, are in constant demand by people needing basic, inexpensive transportation.</li>
										<li>The sale of convertibles and sports cars is seasonal. Sunny weather brings out the buyers. Fall and winter months will be slow.</li>
										<li>Trucks and vans, used for work, are steady sellers and command competitive prices. Don't underestimate their value.</li>
										<li>Collector cars will take longer to sell and are often difficult to price. However, these cars can have unexpected value if you find the right buyer.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Your first step is to check on-line classified ads to see how much other sellers are asking for your type of car. Keep in mind that dealers will have different prices than private party listings. The eBay.com classifieds and other Internet sites allow you to search with specific criteria. For example, select the year and trim level of your car and see how many similar cars are currently on the market. Take note of their condition, mileage, geographic location and selling price so you can list your car at a price that will sell it quickly</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 2: Price Your Car Competitively</h2>
								<p>Once you have surveyed the on-line classified ads, use <span>the Edmunds Appraisal tool</span> to determine the fair value of your car. Edmunds.com adjusts its TMV prices for mileage, color, region, options and condition.</p>
								<p>There are always some exceptions to the rules of pricing, so you should follow your intuition. And be sure to leave a little wiggle room in your asking price. Ask for slightly more money than you are willing to accept. If you want to get $12,000 for the car, you should list the car at $13,500. People tend to negotiate in big chunks ($500-$1,000) rather than small increments ($100-$200). That way, when a person makes you a lower offer, it will be closer to your actual price, rather than below it.</p>
								<p>You may have noticed how creative used-car dealers get in pricing cars. Their prices usually end in "995," as in $12,995. Are we not supposed to notice that the car basically costs $13,000? There is a lot of psychology in setting prices. A product that doesn't sell well at $20 might jump off the shelf at $19.95.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, as a private party seller, you don't want to look like a car dealer. Therefore, you might want to take a simple approach and set your price at a round figure such as $14,000 or $13,500.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 3: Give Your Car "Curb Appeal"</h2>
								<p>When people come to look at your car, they will probably make up their minds to buy it or not within the first few seconds. This is based on their first look at the car. So, you want this first look to be positive. You want your car to have "curb appeal."</p>
								<p>Before you advertise your car for sale, make sure it looks clean and attractive. This goes beyond just taking it to the car wash. Here is a to-do list to help you turn your heap into a cream puff:</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Wash and vacuum the car and consider having it detailed.</li>
										<li>Make sure your car is both mechanically sound and free from dents, dings and scrapes.</li>
										<li>Consider making low-cost repairs yourself rather than selling it "as is."</li>
										<li>Shovel out all the junk from the inside of the car. That way, when a prospective buyer goes for a test-drive, they can visualize the car as theirs.</li>
										<li>Wipe the brake dust off the wheel covers and treat the tires with a tire gloss product.</li>
										<li>Thoroughly clean the windows (inside and out) and all the mirrored surfaces.</li>
										<li>Wipe down the dashboard and empty the ashtrays.</li>
										<li>Have all your maintenance records ready to show prospective buyers.</li>
										<li>If the car needs servicing or even a routine oil change, take care of that before putting it up for sale.</li>
										<li>Have your mechanic check out the car and issue a report about its condition. You can use this to motivate a buyer who is on the fence.</li>
										<li>Order a vehicle history report from <span>Autocheck.com</span> and show it to the buyer to prove the car's title is clean and the odometer reading is accurate.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 4: Where to Advertise Your Car</h2>
								<p>Now that your car is looking great and running well, it's time to advertise it for sale. In the past, people advertised in expensive newspaper classified ads. But now, on-line classified ads are the preferred method, not only for convenience, but also because they have a wider geographical reach.</p>
								<p>Here are the main markets for advertising used cars:</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Web sites: AutoTrader.com, Cars.com, Craigslist.com and eBay Classifieds are the most popular. Craigslist and eBay classifieds are free. The others are not.</li>
										<li>Social media: Use Facebook and Twitter to let your circle know you are selling your car. Ask your contacts to spread the word.</li>
										<li>Peer-to-peer sites: Companies such as Beepi, Carvana, Tred and Zipflip connect buyer and sellers and are a growing presence in the used-car marketplace online. Each operates a little differently, so check the sites for details of their services. These can include car inspections, warranties and return policies for buyers.</li>
										<li>Message boards: Many online car forums have classified sections in which you can list your car.</li>
										<li>Word of mouth: Tell your friends, co-workers and family.</li>
										<li>The car itself: It's old-fashioned, but putting a "For Sale" sign in the car window can be an effective way to sell it.</li>
										<p>One last word of advice about advertising: if you run a classified ad, be sure you are available to take phone calls — and texts — from possible buyers. Many people won't leave a message for a return call. So, answer the phone or reply quickly to a text — and be polite. Creating a good first impression is the first step in getting buyers to see the car in person.</p>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 5: Create Ads That Sell</h2>
								<p>Think about what you are telling people when you write your ad. Little words convey a lot. Besides the price, your ad should also include the year, make, model and trim level of the car you are selling along with the mileage, color, condition and popular options.</p>
								<p>When creating "For Sale" signs or putting an ad online, you have an opportunity to show how eager you are to sell the car. Do this with the following abbreviations and phrases:</p>
								<p>Must Sell! This often means the seller is leaving town and needs to dump the car at a fire sale price.</p>
								<p>OBO: This stands for "or best offer" and it indicates that you are willing to entertain offers below the stated price. This usually means you are eager to sell the car.</p>
								<p>Asking price: This also communicates the feeling that you will negotiate, but it is one notch below OBO on the eagerness scale.</p>
								<p>Firm: This word is used to rebuff attempts to negotiate. It indicates that you aren't in a hurry to sell the car — you are most interested in getting your price.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 6: Showing Your Car</h2>
								<p>There are many unexpected bumps in the road that can arise while selling a used car. These will be handled easily if you are dealing with a reasonable person. So, as you are contacted by prospective buyers, use your intuition to evaluate them. If they seem difficult, pushy or even shady, wait for another buyer. With the right person, selling a used car should be simple.</p>
								<p>Some sellers feel uncomfortable about having buyers come to their house to see the car. However, you can generally screen buyers on the phone. If they sound suspicious, don't do business with them. If you don't want people knowing where you live, arrange to show the car at a park or shopping center near your home. However, keep in mind that people will eventually see your address when you sign the title over to them.</p>
								<p>Keep in mind that when you sell your car, people will also be evaluating you. They will be thinking, "Here's the person who's owned this car for the past few years. Do I trust him or her?" Buyers will probably be uneasy about making a big decision and spending money. Put them at ease and answer their questions openly.</p>
								<p>Potential buyers will want to test-drive the car. If in doubt, check to make sure they have a driver license. Ride along with them so you can answer any questions about the car's history and performance. Also, they may not know the area, so you might have to guide them.</p>
								<p>Some buyers will want to take the car to a mechanic to have it inspected. If you have an inspection report from your mechanic, this might put their doubts to rest. However, if they still want to take the car to their mechanic, this is a reasonable request. By now, you should have a feeling for the person's trustworthiness. If you feel uncomfortable or have reason to think they will steal the car, decline the offer or go along with them.</p>
								<p>Be ready for trick questions such as, "So, what's really wrong with the car?" If you get this, refer them to the mechanic's report or invite them to look over the car more carefully.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 7: Negotiate for Your Best Price</h2>
								<p>If a person comes to look at the car and it passes their approval after a test-drive, you can expect them to make an offer. Most people are uncomfortable negotiating, so their opening offer might take several forms.</p>
								<p><strong>"I like the car, but..."</strong> This is the softest way to negotiate on the price. They may not even state that the price seems too high. If they say, "I like the car, but..." and then lapse into uncomfortable silence, you might consider an appropriate response. If you really want to move the car, you could say, "How much would you be willing to pay?"</p>
								<p><strong>"What's your best price?"</strong> This is a more direct way to probe the seller to find out how much he or she will come down. If you get this from a prospective buyer, don't seem too eager to reduce your price.</p>
								<p><strong>"Would you accept...?"</strong> Now we're getting somewhere. This buyer has thought it over and is making an offer. But the offer is being presented in a polite manner designed to allow for a counter offer.</p>
								<p><strong>"Take it or leave it."</strong> This buyer is making an offer that supposedly leaves no room for a counter offer. This buyer might be bluffing. Still, they are sending a message that they are close to their final price. The only way to know for sure whether it really is a "take it or leave it" offer is to leave it — and let them leave. They may return tomorrow ready to pay your price.</p>
								<p>The above are just a few of the openers you might encounter. Think of your responses ahead of time so you won't be caught unprepared. In general, it's a good idea to hold to your price when your car first goes up for sale. If you don't get any buyers right away, you'll know you must be flexible about the price.</p>
								<p>If you post an online ad you might get people trying to negotiate via e-mail. The problem with this is that they haven't even seen the car yet. If you discount the price by e-mail, they may ask for another price reduction after they've inspected it. Instead, respond by saying, "Come see the car first and then we can discuss the price."</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 8: Handling Complications</h2>
								<p>In some cases, you might reach an agreement with a buyer that is contingent on performing repair work on the car. This can lead to misunderstandings down the line, so avoid this if you can. The best thing to do is have your car in good running order while being fully aware of any necessary repairs. If you state clearly in your ads that the car is being sold "as is," you can refer to this statement when it's time to close the deal.</p>
								<p>Still, a trip to the prospective buyer's mechanic might turn up a new question about the car's condition. What to do?</p>
								<p>This must be handled on a case-by-case basis. If the repair is needed and you trust the mechanic's assessment, you could propose reducing the agreed-upon price by all, or part, of the amount for the repair. If the repair is questionable but the buyer is insistent, split the difference, or have the car taken to your mechanic for further evaluation.</p>
								<p>Remember, the older the car, the more a mechanic is likely to find. At some point, you must draw the line. You may have to say to the buyer, "True, this work could be done. But the car drives well as it is. And the proposed repair isn't addressing a safety concern." After all, a used car — particularly an old one — isn't expected to be perfect.</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 9: Finalize the Sale</h2>
								<p>Rules governing the sale of motor vehicles vary from state to state. Make sure you check with the department of motor vehicles (DMV) in your state, and keep in mind that much of the information is now available on DMV Web sites.</p>
								<p>When selling your car, it's important to limit your liability. If someone drives away in the car you just sold, and they get into an accident, can you be held responsible? There are two ways to deal with this concern.</p>
								<p>Once you have the money from the sale (it's customary to request either cash or a cashier's check), record the odometer reading and sign the car's title over to the buyer. In some states, the license plates go along with the car. A new title will be issued and mailed to the new owner. Additionally, in most states, a release-of-liability form can be downloaded from the DMV Web site or filled out online. This establishes the time the car left your possession.</p>
								<p>But what if you still owe money on the car, and the bank is holding the title? One way to deal with this is to conclude the sale at the bank where the title is held. Call ahead and have the title ready. Then, once money has changed hands and the bank has been paid the balance of the loan, sign the title over to the buyer.</p>
								<p>In some cases, however, an out-of-state bank might hold the title. In this instance, we recommend you go with the buyer to the DMV and get a temporary operating permit based on a bill of sale. Then, after you pay off the balance of the loan with the proceeds from the car sale, have the title mailed to the new owner. Sign it over to the new owner and the transaction is complete.</p>
								<p>Finally, remember to contact your insurance agent to cancel your policy on the vehicle you have sold (or transfer the coverage to your new car).</p>
								<h2 class="question">Step 10: After the Sale</h2>
								<p>In most states, the condition of a used car for sale is considered "as is" and no warranty is provided or implied. Therefore, if the car breaks down after you have sold it, you are under no obligation to refund the buyer's money or pay to have it repaired. If you have sold a car to someone who took it for inspection at a garage and the mechanic found nothing wrong with it, you have done all you can to protect yourself and the buyer.</p>
								<p>Be open about the condition of the car before the sale as well as timely and complete in transferring DMV paperwork after the sale. Doing everything correctly when you sell your used car will give you peace of mind when you are done.</p>
								<p>When done correctly, selling a used car can be a win-win situation. You have turned your used car into cash and provided reliable transportation for the next owner. Focus on the benefits to both parties and you are likely to have a smooth and profitable experience..</p>

								<h2>Smokers</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p>Have you ever driven behind someone who is “vaping”? Ok, if you’re like me, you’re asking “What the heck is vaping”? According to Webster’s Dictionary – “…to inhale vapor through the mouth from a usually battery-operated electronic device (such as an electronic cigarette) that’s heats up and vaporizes a liquid or solid that is vaporized to form an aerosol mist”. In other words – SMOKE. Lots of smoke that leaves a sticky residue on all surfaces in your car. Smoke from a cigarette or cigar smoker is not as visible as someone who is vaping, but it stills leaves that sticky, stinky residue. The smell from vaping is different from cigars and cigarettes as it has a sweet, but it still is an irritant to those who are sensitive.</p>
								<p>The smell may not bother you if you are currently smoking, but if you are trying to quit or a someone who recently quit, it can be a real nuisance. Imagine finding that perfect used car – excellent condition, all the options you want, your dream color, at a great price – but it reeks of smoke. Or you’re trying to sell your car – you babied it, changed the oil every 3000 miles, detailed the interior regularly, rotated the tires – but you are a heavy smoker, and it also reeks.</p>
								<p><strong>And ask yourself a question – “Where does all that smoke go?” EVERYWHERE!!!</strong></p>
								<p>Cigarette smoke is one of the most potent and difficult odors to remove because it penetrates and leaves a residue on all surfaces. It’s on your seats and carpets, the headliner, the windows, the dashboard, the doors, the vents for your heating and air conditioner, and all the nooks and crannies in the interior of your car. Again, “Where Does all that Smoke Go?” EVERYWHERE!!!</p>
								<p>So, what can you do? You can take it to be professionally cleaned and detailed or you can do it yourself. Well, one thing you don’t do is mask the odor using a heavily fragranced deodorant because masking is a temporary solution. It may be gone for a while, but that horrible odor will return. Don’t use foul-smelling smoke bombs, because most of the time they don’t work, and they leave behind a heavy scented smell that will only be an irritant for your vehicles occupants. They won’t fix the problem, it will only make it worse. And a professional detail shop may recommend ozone. Ozone will work to remove smoke odor in most cases, but it also has a terrible side effect. In some cases, not all, it will deteriorate the rubber surfaces in your car by drying it out causing it to crack. Think of all the rubber surfaces in your car – hoses, gaskets, dashboard, the center console, to name a few.</p>
								<p><strong>So how can you reduce or remove the cigarette, cigar, or vaping smell?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>1)	Vacuum everything</strong> – the seats, the carpets, the headliner, the area below the rear window, the trunk if you are a very heavy smoker, and don’t forget under the seats.</p>
								<p><strong>2)	Wipe down all surfaces in your car</strong> – the dashboard, the doors, the seatbelts, any vinyl/leather surfaces on your seats, use a toothbrush or any soft bristle brush to clean all those nooks, crannies, edges, and seams throughout the vehicle. Remember smoke goes everywhere.</p>
								<p><strong>3)	Replace the vehicles cabin air filter</strong>. This is one of the basic maintenance activities for your car, but most of the time it is the most overlooked. The cabin air filter cleans the air that comes into the car as it filters stagnant air, allergens, dust and the stinky smoke smell. If that filter is dirty it can possibly cause you to get headaches. Compared to other spaces, the cabin of your car is quite small, causing that smoke to become much more concentrated. This means that with a clogged and dirty air filter you may breathe in more fumes, particles and smoke. </p>
								<p><strong>4)	Have the interior of your car professionally detailed</strong>. Have the carpets, seats and headliner cleaned.</p>
								<p><strong>5)   Now, this is where the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System come in. With the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System</strong> we can remove all odors in any type of vehicle – Autos, Vans, Buses, Trucks, SUV’s, Recreation Vehicles, all types of Watercraft, Semi-Cabs) 100% of the time – Guaranteed. Most vehicles can be deodorized in as little as 1 hour. (PLEASE NOTE: The source of the odor must be removed once that has been determined, wipe down all hard surfaces, vacuum any debris from the seat, carpets, headliner, and under the seats, and have the seats, and carpets professionally cleaned if they are heavily soled.)</p>
								<p>The <strong>Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System</strong> sanitizes and deodorizes by first using an advanced “Dry Fog” system that gets everywhere to remove harmful germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and indoor contaminants, including cigarette, cigar and vaping smoke, without leaving any harmful residues. We are basically recreating the smoke that is made from a cigarette, cigar, or by vaping. It doesn’t use harsh toxic chemicals, or heavy fragrances and in some cases, you may not be required to do the time consuming manual wipe downs or rinsing. Even delicate surfaces and the heating and cooling systems can be sanitized against a multitude of germs, allergens, odors and indoor contaminates in a fraction of the time and with the highest degree of effectiveness.</p>
								<p>During the use of the <strong>Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System</strong>, the <strong>“Dry Fog”</strong> is circulated thru the heating and cooling vents by running that system during the Just Gone Treatment. The <strong>“Dry Fog”</strong> that is used will neutralize that nasty smoke residue leaving your car smelling fresh and clean without leaving a heavy scented fragrance. Just Gone removes that smoke odor, it doesn’t make the odor.</p>
								<p>Second, utilizing our <strong>Patented Zoono Technology</strong>, our surface protector provides a defensive shield against mold, bacteria, and viruses. <strong>Zoono is antimicrobial nanotechnology that uses intelligent molecules to actively and consistently reduce pathogen loads on surfaces by using physics to kill germs instead of chemistry</strong>. What does that mean? It means that <strong>Zoono Technology</strong> is less toxic than Vitamin C, yet providing you with the Peace of Mind that your vehicle is odor free, and all odors and bacterial problems are effectively eliminated for up to 90 days. Nothing works as well as the <strong>Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorizing System</strong>.</p>

We also use it on the dogs when walking in wooded area or marshy fields and they are not affected by bug bites. The fragrance is wonderful.

								<h2>Allergies</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p><strong>Your day begins as usual</strong> – wake-up, hit the snooze button, shower, get dressed, grab something to eat on the run, get the kids off to school, and get to your car to do whatever it is you do. The long commute to work, drive the kids to school and later driving them to all their many activities, or just driving around doing errands. <strong>How much time do you spend in your car?</strong> And how sick is your car making you?</p>
								<p>Our car is one of the places we spend most of our day, especially if we have a long commute. But this can be problematic if you have allergies. Because here’s the question – <strong>How do you deal with your allergies when you are driving?</strong> Do you sneeze more often? Are your eyes itchy causing them to water? Does this interfere with your ability to drive? You bet it does!</p>
								<p><strong>So, what can you do to help rectify these problems?</strong> Go visit your doctor to verify if you have allergies or not, and if you do see what you can do to relieve symptoms. And if you have already been to the doctor take your prescribed medications. And by the way, as with any medications, make sure that there are no side effects such as drowsiness that could severely affect your ability to drive. And keep a box of tissue in the car if you do start to sneeze and get watery eyes.</p>
								<p><strong>But what if that car, where you spend all that time, is contributing to or is causing your allergy problems?</strong> And if you are not practicing basic annual maintenance on your car, it could be making things worse. So, what can you do?  Try this!</p>
								<p><strong>1)	Vacuum! Vacuum! Vacuum!</strong> Vacuum the seats. Vacuum the carpets. Vacuum the headliner. Vacuum under the seats. Vacuum the floor mats. And do this on a regular basis. This is especially important if you drive around with your pets.</p>
								<p><strong>2)	Replace Your Car’s Cabin Air Filter</strong>. This is one of the basic maintenance activities for your car, but most of the time it is the most overlooked. The cabin air filter cleans the air that comes into the car as they filter out allergens like pollen, dust and other irritants. Cabin filters even keep out exhaust gases from your car and other cars while you stand in rush hour traffic. If the filter is dirty it can possibly cause you to get headaches or your allergies to get worse. Compared to other spaces, the cabin of your car is quite small, causing those musty odors, dust and allergens to become much more concentrated. This means that with a clogged and dirty air filter you may breathe in more fumes and particles than in larger spaces. So those e with allergies may notice their symptoms to be worse and even if your do not typically suffer from allergies you may develop symptoms.</p>
								<p><strong>3)	Keep Your Car Clean</strong>. Wipe down the hard surfaces of your car on a regular basis. This includes the doors, the console and even the dashboard. <strong>And have your seats and carpets professionally cleaned on a regular basis</strong>.</p>
								<p><strong>4)	Do Not Use Heavily Fragranced Deodorants</strong>. If you have your car cleaned or you do it yourself don’t use those foul-smelling smoke bombs, because most of the time they don’t work, and they only leave behind a heavy scented smell that will only be an irritant for someone with allergies. They won’t fix the problem, it will only make it worse.</p>
								<p><strong>5)	That’s where the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System come in</strong>.

								<h2>Flooded Vehicles</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p><strong>How do you not get duped into purchasing a flood damaged vehicle?</strong></p>
								<p>Hurricane Harvey damaged 500,000 to 1 million cars alone when it hit Texas and the surrounding states – double the number of vehicles damaged by Katrina. Those numbers do not include Irma and Jose that hit Florida and the East coast of the U.S. And do not forget Maria in Puerto Rico. Those numbers do not include the damage done to buses, RV’s, boats, and Semi’s. Many of these damaged vehicles and boats will end up in all parts on the country for sale to unsuspecting consumers and businesses as reported by many consumer advocates warn.</p>
								<p><strong>So how do you prevent this from happening? What do you look for when you are purchasing a used or pre-owned vehicle?</strong></p>
								<p>To find out, we went to the <strong>Experts</strong> to learn how to avoid buying that flood damaged vehicle – <strong>CARFAX</strong> – Remember – “Show Me the Carfax?” Well, we did, and here is the information that they have provided.</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Telltale Signs of Flooding</h2>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>A musty odor in the interior, which can sometimes be covered with a strong air-freshener</li>
										<li>Upholstery or carpeting which is loose, new, stained or doesn’t match</li>
										<li>Damp carpets</li>
										<li>Rust around doors, under the dashboard, on the pedals or inside the hood and trunk latches</li>
										<li>Mud or silt in the glove compartment or under the seats</li>
										<li>Brittle wires under the dashboard</li>
										<li>Fog or moisture beads in the interior lights, exterior lights or instrument panel</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Flood Damage Checklist</h2>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Turn on the ignition and check all instrument panel lights illuminate</li>
										<li>Test the interior and exterior lights, air conditioning, windshield wipers, radio, turn signals and heater repeatedly</li>
										<li>View the full CARFAX Vehicle History Report to check for reported flood damage or signs of salvage title fraud</li>
										<li>Get the car checked thoroughly by a trusted mechanic</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">How to Avoid Flood Damaged Cars</h2>
								<p>In more ways than one, water is your car’s best friend. The cooling system uses the stuff to regulate engine temperatures and regular use of a soapy bucket of H20 and a sponge can go a long way toward keeping your pride and joy looking tip-top.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, water can also be your vehicles worst enemy. Damaging flood waters can render a valuable automobile worthless in a matter of seconds.</p>
								<p>Often, flood damaged cars are reported to insurance agencies and through an assessment process the buyer receives compensation to cover losses. While many flooded vehicles are then sent to the auto recycler for dismantling, other vehicles are branded by state agencies as flood damaged and a salvage title is assigned. Once identified, flood damaged cars can once again enter the sales market, showing up on dealer lots or in driveways with for sale signs on the windshield. The truth is, refurbished flood damaged vehicles can be difficult to identify apart from trusted documentation.</p>
								<p>While the majority of those refurbished vehicles are sold with full disclosure of the damage, there are also unscrupulous companies and individuals who will attempt to profit at the expense of others by withholding information or intentionally hiding a car’s history through a process called “title washing.” Whether they simply leave information off the table or deliberately work to erase the car’s history, they will attempt to sell the vehicle as if it never went for a damaging swim.</p>
								<p>While there is no absolute fail-proof technique to avoid a financially devastating purchase of a misrepresented flood vehicle, steps can be taken to assure that the car you are buying lives up to all the seller’s promises and hype.</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Find a Reputable Seller</h2>
								<p>You’ve done hours of research online, consulted friends and family, window shopped at parking lots and in traffic, and settled on a particular model or two. The next important step you need to take is finding a reputable seller.</p>
								<p>Well-established dealerships are not in business for short term financial profit. If your community has a family-owned dealer that has been in the same location for three decades, there is a good chance they aren’t going to risk everything to make a few quick dollars selling misrepresented flood vehicles. Most great dealerships will add the extra security of providing you with a CARFAX Vehicle History Report that clearly documents a detailed history of the vehicle. This high level of transparency along with recommendations from other customers can go a long way in assuring that a potential vehicle purchase is clear of hidden damage.</p>
								<p>Ask good questions, too. Specifically, inquire if the vehicle was ever damaged in a flood. Get your answers in writing and if the seller is unwilling to provide clear evidence, move on. There are plenty of other dealers who are more than willing to go the extra mile to guarantee that you aren’t buying a vehicle with a salvage title.</p>
								<p>The same basic rules work when buying from an individual. Once again, obtaining a vehicle history report goes a long way in confirming that the car you are purchasing is clear of flood damage. Inspecting the title can also help. Check for a stamp that reads “flood” or “salvage.”</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Inspect the Interior</h2>
								<p>Once you’ve determined from the seller that the vehicle is clear of flood damage, take a little time to confirm the reports by inspecting the car firsthand. The following steps are simple to work through and will provide yet another level of confidence before you hand over your cash.</p>
								<p>Thoroughly inspecting for flood damage has a secondary benefit of offering a systematic approach for examining the vehicle for other potential deal-breaking, non-flood related issues.</p>
								<p>The easiest flood damage test is also the most telling. Close all the windows and doors let the car sit for a few minutes and then crack open the door a take a good sniff. Mildew and mold have a distinct smell, and even trace amounts of either one is pretty apparent if the car is sealed. If you have a friend or family member who regularly complains about smells that everyone else seems oblivious to, bring them along. The “Do you smell that?” question they frequently ask might save you thousands of dollars.</p>
								<p>You should also beware of cars that smell too good, since a spray-on fabric freshener can mask odors. If the 5-year-old minivan smells like “fresh mountain rain” make sure that it really isn’t actually flood waters that the scent is masking.</p>
								<p>If the car passes the sniff test it is time to take off the gloves and give the car’s interior a quick pat down to reveal potentially damaging hidden issues. Damp spots under the seats are of particular interest; if you can lift the carpet and inspect the padding, even better. While it is easy to dry the carpet’s surface, foam or jute padding can retain moisture for years.</p>
								<p>During your inspection look for previous water damage evidence by blotchy water stains. Just remember, stains do not necessarily mean the vehicle has been in a flood. Any parent of a toddler can attest to that.</p>
								<p>Don’t forget to check the trunk, either. Take out the spare tire and check for moisture or sitting water. While there is a slight chance of a bad seal around the trunk lid, water or debris found in the trunk area is a good sign that your potential purchase went for a swim.</p>
								<p>As you are working through the car looking for moisture, check for signs of corrosion. Unfinished metal surfaces, like the springs hidden underneath many vehicle seats, will corrode even if the car was only under water for a short time. Look at the ends of exposed bolts. Are they shiny and new or do they look like they’ve been sitting outside? Door jambs and any other areas where water can sit will be especially telling. Bubbling of the paint in areas not exposed to the elements should be taken seriously; even if the car wasn’t in a flood you could be looking at extensive rust damage that may cause a vehicle to fail inspections and be dangerous to drive.</p>
								<p>Take a good look at the vehicle’s instrument panel. Is there trapped moisture behind the plastic lenses? Check the glove box for moisture and debris. Grab a flashlight and look in the console and under the dashboard.</p>
								<p>The car smells great, seems rust free and is dry as a bone, now what? While there is a good chance that the vehicle is just fine, don’t rule out the chance that parts or all of the carpet or interior have been replaced to hide damage. If a section of the carpet or upholstery is a different shade or has less wear than the surrounding fabric, there may be a reasonable explanation, but it may be the sign of undisclosed refurbishment. Once again, cars get dirty and worn and a dealer looking for top profits may replace worn carpet or seating surfaces, but they will be proud of this fact and disclose it quickly and earnestly. What we are looking for is inconsistencies and exposing potential secrets or unknowns.</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Check Under the Hood</h2>
								<p>The vehicle’s interior is the best place to start, but tell-tale signs of water damage can also reside under the hood. Look for debris that may have washed in and deposited itself in the engine bay’s nooks and crannies. Anyone who enjoys a shade tree covering their driveway knows that leaves often sneak into the oddest places, but finding unexplained leaves, silt and sand inside the spark plug wire cavities is concerning and likely the result of flood waters.</p>
								<p>While you are under the hood check the engine oil by pulling the dipstick. When oil mixes with even a small amount of water it becomes murky, like a melted chocolate milkshake. If the oil looks a little suspicious start the car and check it again, sometimes the water will settle above the oil if the car has been sitting for a while and turning the engine over will whip it all back up into a tell-tale mess. It is important to note that any water in the oil is a bad sign. Even if the car has not been in a flood, water in the engine oil may be a sign of major mechanical damage. Either way, if the oil looks like it is dripping with melted ice cream, you should move on. If the vehicle is equipped with a transmission dip stick, check that too.</p>
								<p>Take a few minutes and inspect the paper air filter. Most cars only require a few clips to be undone or some screws to be removed to expose the filter. Once paper is wet it never looks the same. Think of it as that little strip in your cellphone that turns pink if you drop it in a puddle. If the filter shows signs of water stains you will want to keep looking for another vehicle.</p>
								<p>After you’ve inspected the interior and under the hood, take a walk around the vehicle and look for signs of moisture in the light fixtures. While it may well be a leaking seal, fogged-up lights are a good sign that the vehicle was submerged under water. Get close and inspect for tiny drilled holes that may have been added to drain flood water.</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Take a Test Drive</h2>
								<p>Any vehicle purchase requires a lengthy test drive. If you are seriously considering buying a vehicle and you don’t drive it, you are only asking for trouble. Obviously there are exceptions, non-running vintage vehicles for instance, but if you are purchasing a daily driver you need to drive it before making a purchase. A part of your test drive should include testing the vehicle’s electrical systems, as they are prone to water damage.</p>
								<p>When you start the car do you notice any smoke or odd smells? Listen for irregular noises, such as strained warning buzzers. Try every accessory to see if it works properly, including turn signals, windshield wipers, headlight switches and high beams. If you can switch it on or off, you should. Does everything work properly? Turn on the vehicle’s entertainment system and listen to the audio. Like the air filter, paper speaker cones don’t take to water very well. If the audio is distorted or the system doesn’t work, it could be the sign that the car was once being used as a boat.</p>
								<h2 class="subhead2">Ask an Expert</h2>
								<p>It never hurts to get a second opinion, and there are reputable experts available to inspect your potential vehicle purchase for a small fee. Often, they can spot water damage in minutes, but if the car is particularly suspect they may remove a door panel or check hidden electrical or mechanical components to see if there is evidence that the original refurbishment might have missed.</p>
								<p>Bringing your car to a trusted mechanic is a good idea regardless. The nominal upfront costs will pale in comparison to the financial devastation that can result in buying a car that is worth less money than you paid or worse, is dangerous to drive.</p>
								<p>So, it’s safe to say, after reading the information provided by CARFAX, you better be prepared to do your homework. Unfortunately for the buyer there are unscrupulous sellers out there trying to put these damaged cars out on the used car market.</p>

								<h2>Disabling Health Issues</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p>Illness, compromised immune system, chemotherapy – at times like these we need to be very cautious and protective against contamination from germs, bacteria, viruses, fungi and mold. Your car is not only a means of transportation, but it also keeps someone who is undergoing one of these traumatic situations from being isolated. Unfortunately, it also could become an incubator for those things that could make you sicker.</p>
								<p>Finding out that you, or someone you care about must undergo chemotherapy is a very scary time. While you most certainly will have many questions about your treatment, you must also take into consideration the preparations that will be needed in your home and car to give the patient the best chance to stay healthy.</p>
								<p>When your immune system is needed the most, it is under constant attack. It is important to keep your home and car as clean as possible during this time. Viruses and bacteria that would only be an inconvenience to someone with a healthy immune system can be devastating to someone whose immune system is compromised. While chemotherapy can be a life saver in the treatment of cancer, it may also damage your white blood cells, because white blood cells are responsible for protecting your body from infection. When your white blood cell levels drop to low, your immune system will not be able to protect you from the everyday germs we face.</p>
								<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, one out of ten cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy will develop an infection that will need hospital treatment. Germs that are normally harmless to healthy people breed on the skin and in the intestines, which depending on their environment can lead to serious infections in someone receiving cancer treatment. Areas of the body that are more susceptible to infection are the lungs and breathing passages, the skin and mucous membranes, the digestive system, the urinary system and the skin and tissue around a vascular-access device, such as an IV.</p>
								<p>So, what can you do to help those who are in the suffering immunity issues due to illness or chemotherapy treatment. First, how do you stay safe?</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Know your infection risk</li>
										<li>Know what you can do to avoid infection, KEEP IT IN CHECK</li>
										<li>Know the signs of imminent infection</li>
										<li>If on Chemotherapy know the possible side effects.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>How do you prepare your car and home?</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>Keep all surfaces clean.</li>
										<li>Vacuum your home and car frequently with a vacuum that has a HEPA filter</li>
										<li>Wash your hands frequently</li>
										<li>Carry disposable gloves</li>
										<li>Avoid those who are sick</li>
										<li>Masks should be available for both the patient and family and friends of the patient</li>
										<li>All sources of mold should be cleaned and/or removed</li>
										<li>Make sure air filters in your home and car are regularly changed</li>
										<li>If you have pets, they should be groomed and shampooed frequently</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Please note, these suggestions are just the start as to how to prepare and maintain during a severe illness or chemotherapy treatment. You should be in constant contact with your doctor about your situation and remember to ask questions. Be proactive in the concerns of your health. Other sources of information include:</p>

								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>The Zoono Z-Odorizer Mini Fogger offers a totally new concept in odor control – it physically kills the germs that cause odor and by bonding to surfaces it is applied to, keeps killing these germs for months.</li>
										<li>Great for use in closed spaces to take care of mildew and musty odors.</li>
										<li>The Zoono Z-Odorizer Mini Fogger is delivered to an area as a very fine mist. Once dried, the Zoono molecule is effectively anchored to a surface via covalent bonding (it bonds permanently!)</li>
										<li>Not only does the Zoono Z-Odorizer formula start to kill germs on contact but sets up a protective barrier that continues to kill germs and prevents them from coming back, protecting the surfaces it is applied to for months!</li>
										<li>Unlike conventional odor control products, the ZOONO Z-Odorizer does not treat odors by covering them up with scents or even kill odor causing bacteria by chemical poisoning. These strategies are just masking odor or are at best temporary. Zoono Z-Odorizer Mini Fogger lays down a protective barrier on surfaces that permanently bonds to all kinds of surfaces that includes hard surfaces like plastic and glass as well as fabrics like drapes, carpets and upholstery. The protective Zoono barrier eliminated odors on application but keeps working for months after.</li>
										<li>The Zoono Molecule is not consumed in the act of killing germ’s, so it is able to keep killing germs long after it is applied – other products only kill germs while they are wet which means they only work for a few minutes at most.</li>
										<li>The benefit of fogging with the Zoono Z-Odorizer Mini Fogger is that it can reach hard to reach areas in vents and crevices providing a very effective, comprehensive coverage.</li>
										<li>Easy to use: simply depress the trigger and in 10 minutes the aerosol will effectively treat 300sq of space.</li>
										<li>Unique aerosol – the aerosol is unlike other aerosols in that the particle size is so small it creates a cloud that can get into the tightest cracks and get to the odor causing germs that live there.</li>
										<li>Fast Drying – a single application will take 7-10 minutes to fully release from the can and will be dry before the fog dissipates.</li>
										<li>highly effective against bacterial odors, mold, and mildew - even organic pet smells. Zoono USA</li>

								<h2>Recreation Vehicles & Watercraft</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="hr"></div>
							<div class="modal-body">
								<p>One of the greatest pleasures in life is being able to enjoy that beautiful boat or recreation vehicle that you have worked so hard to purchase. But one of the most common issues of boat or RV owners is that musty, moldy odor that occurs every time that you try to use them. Boats and RV’s like to be used, and when they are not used regularly that odor builds up again and again.</p>
								<p>One of the biggest problems in situations like this is that people began to get used to that smell or odor. That’s when it can become a real problem. Sometimes a dangerous problem that could affect your health. That odor can be a sign of many things – something could be decaying or rotting such as wood or paper affected by moisture, a dead animal, a leaking or failed gasket to name a few.</p>
								<p>When your boat or RV is closed and not used for an extended period of time in the hot and humid summer months, or put into storage over the winter moisture builds up inside the cabins of your boat or the interior of your RV.</p>
								<p>So, what can you do to rectify this situation? Here’s some ideas:</p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-item">
										<li>First and foremost – find the source of the problem, A musty smell most likely means that you have moisture and dampness somewhere. And when your boat or RV is closed for an extended period of time you have the 3 things that promote mold or mildew growth – dampness, darkness and warmth. And it doesn’t have to be a leak to cause a build-up of moisture. It could just be caused by temperature fluctuations when it is closed causing condensation.</li>
										<li>Remove any wet or damaged materials.</li>
										<li>Clean out any of the many storage tanks.</li>
										<li>Check the refrigerator or freezer.</li>
										<li>Check the drains in the kitchens and bathrooms</li>
										<li>If you have carpets, make sure that they are dry</li>
										<li>Make sure everything has been cleaned and dry before your Boat or RV is put into storage or locked up for an extended period of time.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>And this is where the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorizing Systems can help keep your boat or RV smelling fresh and clean.</p>
								<p>The <strong>Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System</strong> sanitizes and deodorizes by first using an advanced “Dry Fog” system that gets everywhere to remove harmful germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and indoor contaminants without leaving any harmful residues.

								<p>It happens every day…One of the children spills a milkshake in the car, a package of meat falls out of the grocery bag in the trunk and you don’t find it for three days, someone gets carsick, the dog has an accident. This is part of your daily life, but getting that horrendous odor out of your car can be a real challenge. Whether it’s cigarette smoke odors (the most prevalent), mold or mildew, protein odors (rotting meat, animal dander, or human body fluids), or pollutants from just driving your car, it’s difficult to keep that new car smell.</p>
								<p>Most of the time service providers utilize ozone or other foul-smelling odor bombs that don’t work and in some cases, make the problem even worse. That’s where the Just Gone odor elimination services come in. With the Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System we can remove all odors in any type of vehicle – Autos, Vans, Buses, Trucks, SUV’s, Recreation Vehicles, all types of Watercraft, Semi-Cabs) 100% of the time – Guaranteed. Most vehicles can be deodorized in as little as 1 hour.</p>
								<p><small>(PLEASE NOTE: The source of the odor must be removed once that has been determined, wipe down all hard surfaces, vacuum any debris from the seats, carpets, headliner and under the seats, and have the seats and carpets professionally cleaned if they are heavily soiled.)</small></p>
								<p>The <strong>Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorization System</strong> sanitizes and deodorizes by first using an advanced “Dry Fog” system that gets everywhere to remove harmful germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and indoor contaminants without leaving any harmful residues. It doesn’t use harsh toxic chemicals, fragrances nor does it require time consuming manual wipe downs or rinsing. Even delicate surfaces and the heating and cooling systems can be sanitized against a multitude of germs, allergens, odors and indoor contaminates in a fraction of the time and with the highest degree of effectiveness.</p>
								<p>Second, utilizing our <strong>Patented Zoono Technology</strong>, our surface protector provides a defensive shield against mold, bacteria, and viruses. <strong>Zoono is antimicrobial nanotechnology that uses intelligent molecules to actively and consistently reduce pathogen loads on surfaces by using physics to kill germs instead of chemistry</strong>. What does that mean? It means that <strong>Zoono Technology</strong> is less toxic than Vitamin C, yet providing you with the Peace of Mind that your vehicle is odor free, and all odors and bacterial problems are effectively eliminated for up to 90 days. Nothing works as well as the <strong>Just Gone Sanitizing and Deodorizing System</strong>.</p>

												<h2>AIRFRESH 101’S</h2>
												<h2>GOT MOLD, MILDEW, ODORS?</h2>
												<p>When you’re looking for an air freshener that can kill odors at their source, chlorine dioxide gas is a smart choice. While producing chlorine dioxide (ClO2) used to require expensive generators, Eco-Solutions has developed a unique product, AirFresh 101, which can create this chemical quickly and for an affordable price. When the contents of AirFresh 101’s are activated in water, they produce a slow release ClO2 vapor which can produce and release chlorine dioxide for up to 30 days.</p>
												<p>Depending on the area size and vapor concentration, this chlorine dioxide air freshener will eliminate odor-causing smoke, hydrogen sulfide, pet odors, and much more.</p>
												<p>Best of all, AirRelief is safe to use on nearly all materials, making it an ideal air freshener for many locations, including:</p>
												<p>
													<ul class="list-item">
														<li>RVs</li>
														<li>Boat cabins</li>
														<li>Cars</li>
														<li>Basements</li>
														<li>Public bathrooms/locker rooms</li>
														<li>Hotel/home owners and senior living rooms</li>
														<li>Musky areas</li>
														<li>And almost any other enclosed space</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												<p>In addition to AirFresh 101, we also offer Aqua-Tab tablets that can produce ClO2 solutions perfect for eliminating odor on many surfaces or in small-scale water treatment operations. All of these stabilized chlorine dioxide products ship in airtight packets.</p>
